# Montessori Shop

Montessori Shop is an Ecommerce website where the user can buy or sell used montessori products for children age birth to 3 year old. The original montessori items are made with quality materials and have good resale value. The montessori products can be quite pricy and children outgrew them quickly. That is, the idea of creating an app that serves as a trusted place to buy or sell these products for  a reduced price came from.

In this app, the user can buy or sell their own products. The user can like an item and save it to a favorites list. If the user choose to list an item, they have the option to edit or delete their listing.
